### Other container orchestration tools

* D2IQ - Mesos with Marathon, focus on production level day 2 operations once you get your cluster up and running
* Docker Swarm - Ultimately failed, they just didn't have the exp
* VMWare Tanzu - recently bought by Broadcom, it may be better to stay away from this for now until the dust settles
* Amazon ECS - Proprietary, less expensive
* Amazon EKS - very expensive and only works with them for whatever you spin up
* Rancher - K8s solution provider
* Nomad - Lighter container orchestrater, not just containers, smaller community
* Hadoop - It can work but it's more for big data analytics

## Architecture

**Kubernetes Formal Definition** - There are 3 ways to look at it
* Open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
* Distributed Operating System - Connecting caled and resilient applications scheduled to cluser resources (CPU, Memory, I/O)
* State machine - Manifests sent to imperative controllers that balance between declared states and observed states
